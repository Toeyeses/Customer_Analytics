# Supermarket Revenue Maximization

This repository contains a project aimed at maximizing revenue for a supermarket through two key business strategies: Customer Retention and Customer Acquisition. The strategies are designed to increase the supermarket's revenue by leveraging existing customer segments and targeting new customers effectively.

## Customer Retention Strategy

### Customer Segmentation

To improve customer retention, we first segmented the existing customer base using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) variables. The segmentation resulted in three distinct customer groups:

1. **Nearly Churn** - This group consists of customers who show signs of potential churn. To re-engage them, we have implemented a strategy to offer discounts for their next purchase. The aim is to incentivize these customers to continue shopping with us.

2. **Hi-So Spending** - The high-spending customers are essential for our revenue. To show appreciation and encourage them to continue their spending, we offer special discounts with priority periods. This approach reinforces their loyalty.

3. **Small Pocket** - Customers in this group may not spend as much. To maximize revenue from this segment, we've implemented an up-selling strategy. We recommend product bundling with promotional offers, enticing them to make larger purchases.

### Implementation

- For the **Nearly Churn** group, we have integrated a discount system during checkout. This system identifies customers in this category and offers them discounts based on their past behavior and potential churn risk.

- The **Hi-So Spending** group receives special discount offers with a priority period. These customers are notified of exclusive promotions and discounts via email or SMS, ensuring they feel valued.

- To target the **Small Pocket** group, our system provides product bundling recommendations with promotional offers. We display these recommendations prominently during their shopping experience to encourage additional purchases.

## Customer Acquisition Strategy

In addition to retaining existing customers, we are actively targeting new customers to boost revenue further.

### New Customer Targeting

- We have developed marketing campaigns tailored to attract new customers to our supermarket. These campaigns may include online advertising, social media marketing, and partnerships with local businesses to expand our customer base.

- A user-friendly and engaging website and mobile app have been created to enhance the shopping experience for new customers, making it easy for them to discover our products and services.

## Conclusion

With these two business strategies in place, we are committed to maximizing our supermarket's revenue. By focusing on customer retention and acquisition, we aim to grow our business and provide a satisfying shopping experience for both our loyal customers and newcomers.

Thank you for your interest in our project, and we look forward to sharing our progress and results with you.
