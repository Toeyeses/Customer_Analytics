## Project 1: CDP, CSV & Customer Analysis

### Overview
This project focuses on maximizing revenue for a supermarket through customer retention and acquisition strategies. It includes two main strategies: Customer Retention and Customer Acquisition.

### Customer Retention Strategy
- Segmentation: Existing customers are segmented into "Nearly Churn," "Hi-So Spending," and "Small Pocket" groups based on RFM variables.
- Implementation: Each segment receives targeted strategies like discounts, special offers, and product bundling to retain their business.

### Customer Acquisition Strategy
- New Customer Targeting: Marketing campaigns and user-friendly digital platforms are designed to attract new customers.

## Project 2: Churn Scoring

### Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the travel industry. It involves data analysis and machine learning applied to a dataset called "Customertravel.csv."

### Key Steps
- Data Import and Exploration: The dataset is loaded and explored to understand its structure.
- Data Preprocessing: Data is cleaned, and features are prepared for modeling.
- Model Selection and Evaluation: Various machine learning models are tested and evaluated for their predictive performance.
- Handling Imbalanced Data: Techniques like SMOTE, Random Over-sampling, and Random Under-sampling are applied to address class imbalance.

## Project 3: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis

### Overview
This project focuses on enhancing Dusit International's loyalty program through Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis. It introduces a new CLV scoring feature and addresses pain points in the current loyalty program.

### Key Components
- Current Loyalty Program: Analyzes the current program and identifies pain points.

- Summary: Presents the CLV equation and the potential impact on revenue and customer satisfaction.

## Project 4: Customer Segmentation, Segment Movement, and Product Recommendation Analysis

### Overview
This project involves customer segmentation, segment movement analysis, and product recommendation using a dataset. It aims to improve customer understanding and optimize product recommendations.

### Key Components
- Customer Segmentation: Divides customers into four groups: Freeloaders, Dormants, New Payers, and Loyalists.
- Sankey Diagram: Visualizes customer behavior trends by comparing past and recent payment behaviors.
- Product Recommendation: Implements the Apriori algorithm to generate personalized product recommendations.
- Impact Analysis: Focuses on converting Freeloaders into New Payers to increase revenue.

## Project 5: Voice of Customer (Topic Modeling)

### Overview
This project performs topic modeling on sunscreen product reviews using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and visualizes the results using `pyLDAvis`. It aims to uncover key themes within customer reviews.

### Key Steps
- Data Import and Preprocessing: Reviews are loaded and cleaned, including text tokenization and dictionary creation.
- Topic Modeling with LDA: Latent Dirichlet Allocation is applied to discover topics within the reviews.
- Topic Visualization: Topics and their relationships are visualized using `pyLDAvis`.

These five projects collectively provide insights into customer analytics, churn prediction, loyalty program enhancement, customer segmentation, and voice of customer analysis. Each project contributes to improving business strategies and decision-making for various aspects of customer engagement and revenue optimization as part of the MADT8101: Customer Analytics coursework.
