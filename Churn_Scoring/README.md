Create churn prediction model to predict Customertraveler.csv that whic customer going to churn

According to "Basic_Churn_Prediction.inpy" this file is an  example of data analysis and machine learning applied to a dataset called "Customertravel.csv." And here's a summary and explanation of the code in notebook:

1. **Importing Libraries**: The code starts by importing various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. These libraries are commonly used for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

2. **Importing Data**: It loads the dataset "Customertravel.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame called `df`. This dataset likely contains information about customers and their travel habits.

3. **Exploring Data**: Several exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks are performed:
   - `df.head()`: Displays the first few rows of the dataset.
   - `df.isna().sum()`: Counts and displays the number of missing values in each column.
   - `df.describe()`: Provides summary statistics for numerical columns.
   - `df.iloc[2]`: Prints the data for the third row in the dataset.
   - Various Seaborn plots (`sns.boxplot`, `sns.barplot`, and `sns.heatmap`) are used to visualize relationships between different columns in the dataset.

4. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Dummy variables are created for categorical features like 'FrequentFlyer' and 'AnnualIncomeClass.'
   - The 'AnnualIncomeClass' column is mapped to numeric values.

5. **Feature Selection and Target Variable**: The code creates the feature matrix `X` by selecting specific columns from the DataFrame and concatenating them with the dummy variables. The target variable `y` is defined.

6. **Model Selection and Evaluation**: Several machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and K Nearest Neighbors) are used for classification. The code splits the data into training and testing sets and defines a function (`fit_evaluate`) to fit these models, evaluate them, and display results, including classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.

7. **Handling Imbalanced Data**:
   - The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to balance the class distribution by oversampling the minority class.
   - Random Over-sampling (ROS) and Random Under-sampling (RUS) are also applied to address class imbalance.

8. **XGBoost Classifier**: An XGBoost classifier is trained and evaluated both with and without hyperparameter tuning. Grid search is used to find the best hyperparameters for the model.

9. **Building a Pipeline**: A machine learning pipeline is created, including feature selection and the XGBoost classifier.

10. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search is performed to find the best combination of hyperparameters for the XGBoost classifier using cross-validation. Multiple scoring metrics (AUC, Accuracy, F1 score) are used for evaluation.

11. **Final Model Evaluation**: The best-performing XGBoost classifier is evaluated on the test set using various metrics, including accuracy, ROC curves, and classification reports.

Overall, this code performs a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, handles class imbalance, and applies machine learning techniques to build and evaluate predictive models for a binary classification problem. The use of hyperparameter tuning and model selection techniques enhances the model's performance.
